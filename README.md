## Readme.txt - Universidad Management System

### Introduction

This C++ program, `ProyectoUniversidad.cpp`, implements a simple university management system. The program allows users to register students, record their grades for different courses, and generate reports for students and courses.

### Functionality

The university management system provides the following features:

1. **Student Registration**: Users can register students by providing their names, date of birth, and academic programs (e.g., "Ing. De Software," "Ing. Electronica," etc.).

2. **Course Registration**: Users can register various courses by providing the course name and the number of credits associated with each course.

3. **Grade Recording**: Users can record the grades of students for the registered courses.

4. **Generate Student Report**: Users can generate a report listing all the registered students along with their matriculation numbers, names, academic programs, semesters, and GPAs (Grade Point Averages).

5. **Generate Course Report**: Users can generate a report listing all the registered courses along with their names and credit points.

### Usage

The program provides a simple console-based menu to access and interact with the features mentioned above. To use the program:

1. Run the `ProyectoUniversidad.cpp` file.

2. The program will initialize with sample data of registered students and courses.

3. A menu with various options will be displayed, allowing you to perform different operations.

4. Choose the desired option by typing the corresponding number or character and pressing Enter.

5. Depending on the option selected, the program will prompt you for additional information, such as matriculation numbers, course codes, grades, etc.

6. The program will perform the requested operation and display the relevant information.

### Notes

- The program uses classes and objects to manage the student and course information. The core functionality is implemented in the `Universidad` class.

- The `Menu` class provides a simple menu system to navigate through the different options.
